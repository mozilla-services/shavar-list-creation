shavar-list-creation
====================
    usage: lists2safebrowsing.py

A `shavar_list_creation.ini` file must exist in the same directory that specifies the following parameters. (See `sample_shavar_list_creation.ini` for examples.)

Commits to [shavar-list-exceptions](https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-list-exceptions) trigger rebuilds of [shavar-list-creation](https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-list-creation) like so:

1. A commit is made to [shavar-list-exceptions](https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-list-exceptions)
2. That commit triggers a Jenkins workflow that will pull down the current exception list
3. Jenkins then pulls down the master codebase from [shavar-list-creation](https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-list-creation) and builds the list
4. The completed list is placed in the s3 bucket for production

This job does not run on a cron. This is OK so long as we're not publishing true incremental updates.
